## HTTPS Requirement

**CRITICAL**: Ensure your Render deployment uses **HTTPS**:

2. Under "Custom Domains", make sure you have a custom domain with SSL
3. Or use Render's auto-generated domain (which should have HTTPS by default)

## Troubleshooting

If wallet connection still doesn't work:

1. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools and check for errors
2. **Verify HTTPS**: Ensure the site loads with `https://`
3. **Check Environment Variables**: Verify all variables are set in Render
4. **Clear Cache**: Try clearing browser cache and reconnecting wallet
5. **Network Switch**: Make sure your wallet is on the correct network

## Wallet Compatibility

Most Web3 wallets require HTTPS in production environments. The following wallets are supported:
- MetaMask
- Coinbase Wallet
- Trust Wallet
- WalletConnect compatible wallets

## Testing

Test your deployed version by:
1. Opening the Render URL in a new incognito window
2. Connecting your wallet
3. Trying a small swap transaction
